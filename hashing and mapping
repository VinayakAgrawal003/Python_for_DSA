Hashing:
- Hashing is a technique of storing the key and value pair.
- stored in hash table. Hash table is a data type.
- we have arbitary value and we store in hash table.
- time complexity of best and average case id O(1) and wordt case is O(n).
- worst case happne in very big problem and most of the time we have O(1) as time complexity. 
- in python we use dictionary data type to hashing and hashing is done internally.
