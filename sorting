Selection sort: 
     -
Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted portion and an unsorted portion. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and moves it to the end of the sorted portion. Hereâ€™s how it works step by step:

Start: Begin with the first element as the sorted portion.
Find the Minimum: Scan the unsorted portion to find the minimum element.
Swap: Swap the found minimum element with the first element of the unsorted portion.
Update: Move the boundary between sorted and unsorted portions one element to the right.
Repeat: Repeat steps 2-4 until the entire list is sorted.


Bubble sort:  Concept:-
     - We have to take a unsorted array. 
     - Then we have to make a bubble in the 1st element and then we have to compare them to the next element. 
     - If the next element is smaller swap.
     - and if thee next element is bigger then the bubble moves to the next element. 
     - simple and this process goes on and on 
     - time complexity is O(n2). Easy to calculate
