Bubble sort:  Concept:-
     - We have to take a unsorted array. 
     - Then we have to make a bubble in the 1st element and then we have to compare them to the next element. 
     - If the next element is smaller swap.
     - and if thee next element is bigger then the bubble moves to the next element. 
     - simple and this process goes on and on 
     - time complexity is O(n2). Easy to calculate
