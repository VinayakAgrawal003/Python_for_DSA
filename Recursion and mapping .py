Q1. What is recursion?
Ans. Recursion in the function calling itself again and again.

Q2. Why do we use it?
Ans. We can write our code without recursion, but we must use it for big files. Especially if we talk of projects it is good to use it.
     We use it to make our code more optimal and readable and reduce time complexity.
  
Q3 . How to use it?
Ans. Write a function, write logic inside it, and call that function again.

Questions for practice : 
     
NOTE: ALL THE BELOW QUESTIONS YOU HAVE TO DO WITH THR RECURSION.

Q1. Print your name n times.
Q2. Print linearly from 1 to n.
Q3. Print reversed from 1 to n.
Q4. Print the sum of 1st n numbers. 
Q5. Recursion on Subsequence(order in which it is given)


Q. What is the recursion tree?
When we create the program's flow, it is called a recursion tree. It is incremented first on the left, then on the right, and in the same way read.
- It helps in finding the time complexity of multiple recursion programs simply. 





MAPPING:

Mapping is just like assigning a key or value pair.
and when the key is called value is answered. 
as we use a dictionary sane thing is here. 
mapping is an important concept in Python coding. 
its syntax is map()

Q. how many types of mapping are there?
Ans. there are 2 types of mapping :
     1. ordered mapping 
     2. unordered mapping 
     each of them have there benefits.
